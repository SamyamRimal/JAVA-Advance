Hi, I'm Samyam Rimal 👋

I'm a 19-year-old BIT student currently in my 3rd semester. Alongside my studies, I work as a Computer Assistant and Teacher at a secondary school, teaching computer science to grades 5–8. My passion lies in software development, and I'm currently diving deep into Java. After mastering Java, I plan to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to sharpen my skills and land a job at a big tech company.

🌱 Currently learning: Java
📈 Next up: DSA
🎯 Career goal: Join a top-tier tech company and contribute to innovative projects.
Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Always open to collaboration and learning! 🚀
